# Bitbucket

Your projects are "submitted" via git and Bitbucket. You must first create a free Bitbucket account. Read the [git](/notes/git.html) notes for details about submission.

How to create a Bitbucket account:

1. Create a free [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) account.

2. Create an ssh key and upload it to your Bitbucket account. (For
   help, see Step 6 on the
   [Bitbucket documentation page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git).)

3. Create a repository. Call it "csci201-project-01". Make sure it is a "private" repository.

4. Now, follow the "basic workflow" instructions in the
   [git](/lecture/git.html) notes to create a repository and push it
   to Bitbucket.

5. Back at Bitbucket, refresh the page so you can see your committed
   files. Now, on the right side, click "Send invitation" and type
   "joshuaeckroth". This allows me to view your repository. I will
   only be able to see commits you have "pushed".

You are now done. When I start grading each project, I will visit your
repository and download your code (automatically, with a script I have written).
