# Final review (incomplete)

The final exam will be on paper. You can bring a 5x7 notecard fill with notes front and back. You will see questions like you see on this review.

## Combinational logic

Diagram an OR gate out of NAND gates. Here is the diagram for a NAND gate:

![NAND](/images/nand.png)

Using AND/OR/NOT gates, diagram a 4-way MUX. Here are the diagrams for AND/OR/NOT:

![AND/OR/NOT](/images/and-or-not.jpg)

Write the integer version of the binary number (in 8-bit 2's complement) 01101000. Do the same with 11101110. Now find the negation of 00101000, and write in binary form.

Using AND/OR/NOT gates, diagram a 2-bit adder. Label the "overflow" bit.

## Sequential logic

Using AND/OR/NOT and the DFF gate, diagram a Bit gate. Recall a Bit has an input, a load bit, and an output.

Describe the role of the PC gate.

Using a RAM8 gate (and no other RAM gates), diagram a RAM32 gate. Label the other gates you use.

Explain why we have Register gates in a modern machine and do not just use RAM for everything.

## The whole computer

(something about instruction decoding, sending to ALU, program counter, etc.)

## Assembly language

Translate such-and-such assembly language commands to machine language.

Translate such-and-such machine language commands to assembly language.

## Assembler

(something about the translation process; labels, jumps)

(implement certain algorithms in assembly language)

## VM language

(questions about the stack)

(questions about function calls and the stack manipulations involved)

(implement certain algorithms in assemly language)

(translate some VM code to assembly)

(translate some assembly to equivalent VM)

## Grammars, lexers, parsers, tree visitors

(design a grammar for very small syntax examples)

(given a parse tree and some visitor functions, find the final output after visiting the tree from the root)
