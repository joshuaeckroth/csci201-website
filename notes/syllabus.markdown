I am strongly in agreement with the [Stetson University Honor Code](http://www.stetson.edu/other/honor-system/). Any form of cheating is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and could lead to dismissal from the University. This includes plagiarism of any sort on projects or the final exam.

## Academic success center
