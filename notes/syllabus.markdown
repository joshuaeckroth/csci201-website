## Grading

- Projects (13 of them): 80%
- Final exam: 20%

### Projects

Projects are individual activities. You will turn in your materials via [git](/cookbook/git.html) and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org). See the [RStudio workflow](/notes/rstudio-workflow.html) and [Hadoop workflow](/notes/hadoop-workflow.html) notes for details.

Assignments are scored out of 5 points.

### Late work

Due to the complexity of these assignments and the timing of group work, I will only accept late work up to three days late. Late work is penalized 40%.

## Honor code

You are allowed to a small amount of code from websites (assuming the code is open source) and our book. You must indicate where you got the code (put a comment in the code). More than 50% of your work must be original.

I am strongly in agreement with the [Stetson University Honor Code](http://www.stetson.edu/other/honor-system/). Any form of cheating is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and could lead to dismissal from the University. This includes plagiarism of any sort on quizzes, exams, or on projects. So please, do not cheat!

## Academic success center

If a student anticipates barriers related to the format or requirements of a course, she or he should meet with the course instructor to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (822-7127; [www.stetson.edu/asc](http://www.stetson.edu/asc)) and notify the course instructor of your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. The student, course instructor, and the Academic Success Center will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. The Academic Success Center is located at 209 E Bert Fish Drive, and can be contacted using the email address [asc@stetson.edu](mailto:asc@stetson.edu).
