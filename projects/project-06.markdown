# Project 6

- **Read Chapter 5**, and probably Chapter 4 again.
  - Here are some free chapters: [http://www.nand2tetris.org/chapters/](http://www.nand2tetris.org/chapters/)

- Create a repository on Bitbucket named exactly `csci201-project-06`. Invite me (`joshuaeckroth`) as a reader.

## Task

Write the definitions of `CPU.hdl`, `Memory.hdl`, and `Computer.hdl`. Here is the [ZIP file](/code/project-06.zip).

## Restrictions

- `CPU` must be implemented in 16 gates or fewer.
- `Memory` must return 0 if the memory address is bogus (too high). See the HDL file for details.

These two restrictions differ from the book and online solutions. Note, it is considered cheating if you look at or copy online solutions.

## Extra credit

- Implement `CPU` in 15 gates or fewer.
