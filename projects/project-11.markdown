# Project 11

- Read pp. 121-172

- Create a repository on Bitbucket named exactly `csci201-project-11`. Invite me (`joshuaeckroth`) as a reader.

## Task 1

Update your VM-assembly translator to support the following additional VM commands:

```
function [function name] [num locals]
call [function name] [num args]
return
```

Download the test scripts: [project-11.zip](/code/project-11.zip). Note, in each case there is a "VME.tst" file. That tests the VM code, which is given to you. Use the VME.tst file to see how the VM code behaves. But ultimately, you want to pass the tests with the regular .tst script.
