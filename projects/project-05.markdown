# Project 5

**Download updated simulators:** [csci201-simulators-v2.7.zip](/csci201-simulators-v2.7.zip)

Hey! Do that thing I said above.

- **Read Chapter 4 and the [Assembly Language notes](/notes/assembly-language.html).**
  - Here are some free chapters: [http://www.nand2tetris.org/chapters/](http://www.nand2tetris.org/chapters/)

- Create a repository on Bitbucket named exactly `csci201-project-05`. Invite me (`joshuaeckroth`) as a reader.

## Task 1

Rewrite [`MoveSquare.asm`](/code/MoveSquare.asm) so it has 190 lines of code or fewer. You can see how many lines it has by loading it into the simulator and looking at the last occupied row of ROM. (ROM counts from 0, so 190 is 189.)

**The rewritten version must function exactly as the original.**

Grading will depend on how close to 190 lines you are able to get. Extra credit (+1 pt) will be given if your solution has 170 lines or fewer.

## Task 2

Stay tuned.

## Task 2

In this task, you will rewrite programs we developed in class in MIPS assembly language.

Download the [QtSpim MIPS Simulator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/). The tool's main page is [here](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/).

You will use MIPS32 assembly language, designed for the MIPS processor (used in the Nintendo 64; PlayStation, PS 2, and PS Portable; and millions of other devices).
